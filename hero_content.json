  "title": "Towards Information Propagation Simulations that Capture Real-World Human Social Dynamics: A Behavioural Theory Approach",
  "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to simulate information propagation and opinion dynamics in online social networks, enabling the observation of human behaviour in silico. Yet a central question remains: how can LLM-based simulations be made to more faithfully reflect real-world social dynamics, rather than merely reproducing plausible text? In this work, we argue that established behavioural theories have indispensable roles in guiding, constraining, and validating such simulations. We propose an LLM-based agent framework that systematically integrates multiple behavioural theories into the design of agents’ internal states and their interactions with the environment. This theory-integrated architecture enables us to make explicit how psychological mechanisms unfold within networked contexts. Across validating on multiple real-world datasets, the framework substantially outperforms theory-free models in reproducing empirically observed human behaviour at both the individual and collective levels, as shown by questionnaire replication studies and comparisons with actual online events. Our findings suggest that behavioural theories are far from obsolete in the era of generative AI; instead, they are crucial for building AI social simulation systems that are behaviourally realistic, robust across contexts, and interpretable in terms of the mechanisms they instantiate."
